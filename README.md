# (Unofficial) Delta Green: The RPG Foundry System
This is a fan made Foundry VTT system for Delta Green: The RPG, based on the _Agent's Handbook_ rule set from Arc Dream Publishing (_**not** the Call of Cthulu rules_).  It is unaffiliated with the Delta Green Partnershipt or Arc Dream Publishing (although they did give permission to make the system).  Please consider supporting the publisher by buying a copy of the official rule book which can be done here:

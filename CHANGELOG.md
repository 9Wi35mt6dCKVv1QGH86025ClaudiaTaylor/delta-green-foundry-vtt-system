## Release/Patch Notes

### Version 0.9.4
* Fix - Pharmacy and Surgery skills were missing.
* Fix - Accounting and Disguise base skill rating were 0%, should be 10%.
* Fix - Damage on medium pistol in compendium was wrong, also fixed some base range values that were off.
* Enhancement - Adding support for localization.  Focusing on main character sheet for now.
* Workaround - The (current alpha) 7.2 Foundry release seems to have a bug where rolls without a leading number ('d100') do not work, so updated all skill checks to roll '1d100' instead to avoid the issue.
* Enhancement - Added support for Dice So Nice module, since moving to custom chat message broke out of the box compatibility with it.

### Version 0.9.3
We will never speak of 0.9.1 or 0.9.2 ever again.

### Version 0.9.1

Note that weapon/armor statistics are not covered by the Open Game License like the other rules used in the system, they are included as an exception with permission from Arc Dream publishing.

Basic system functionality complete and submitted to Foundry VTT as an official system.

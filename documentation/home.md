(Under construction, will expand later, for now just list some helpful notes)

## Rolling Checks

Most labels can be clicked to roll a check or test of some kind.

* Click on _SAN_ (label above current/max sanity) to roll a Sanity check.
* Click on any of the skill labels (such as _Accounting_) to roll a skill test.
* Click on the name of a physical statistic (such as _STR_, on the _Physical_ tab) to roll a test.
* Click on a weapon name (on the _Gear_ tab) to roll the skill test associated with it (e.g. _Firearms_).
* Click on the Damage/Lethality associated with a weapon to roll it.

## Where are the Specialized Skills Like 'Science' and 'Pilot'?
Only one 'Typed' skill is shown for an Agent by default, that being Art (Painting), and it is *below* all the other skills.  It can be removed by clicking the trash icon inside the box for the skill.  Likewise, new typed skills can be added by clicking the _+_ button just above the section.

This allows adding any number of skills as needed, without having dead space for unused skills.

## Why Does the 'Lethality' Roll Show Damage Even on a Success?
For Lethality, the D100 test against the target lethality threshold is evaluated like a normal skill test. But regardless of the outcome, the damage associated with a non-lethal roll (2D10) is also displayed in paretheses as lethality does not affect some creatures.

Note - the Lethality roll does not currently take into account the changes that rolling a critical on the associated attack roll involves.  For example, on a critical _Firearms_ check with a weapon with a lethality of 10%, the threshold doubles to 20%, and if that check fails the resulting damage doubles as well.

## Where is The Breaking Point Shown?
It is under the _Mental_ tab, as are the boxes to tick for _Incidents of Sanity Loss Without Going Insane_ and an Agents _Motivations_ and _Disorders_.

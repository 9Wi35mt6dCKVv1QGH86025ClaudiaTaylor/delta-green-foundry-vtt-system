## Rolling Checks

Most labels can be clicked to roll a check or test of some kind.

* Click on _SAN_ (label above current/max sanity) to roll a Sanity check.
* Click on any of the skill labels (such as _Accounting_) to roll a skill test.
* Click on the name of a physical statistic (such as _STR_, on the _Physical_ tab) to roll a test.
* Click on a weapon name (on the _Gear_ tab) to roll the skill test associated with it (e.g. _Firearms_).
* Click on the Damage/Lethality associated with a weapon to roll it.
    * For Lethality, the d100 test is evaluated, but regardless of the outcome the damage associated with rolling the equivalent 2d10 is also displayed in paretheses as lethality does not affect many creatures.
